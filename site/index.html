        <div class="content">
          <p>We're collecting <strong>your</strong> horror stories and will share them as a conference talk, probably at the next <a href="https://www.denog.de/de/" target="_blank">DENOG</a> conference. This was inspired by the <a href="https://entropia.de/GPN18:Sysadmin_Nightmares_2018" target="_blank">Sysadmin Nightmares</a> talk at the <a href="https://entropia.de/GPN18" target="_blank">Gulaschprogrammiernacht 2018</a>. Unfortunately, this talk was not streamed or recorded, so everyone could talk openly. Sysadmin Nightmares was accurately described as <a href="https://twitter.com/pennylane0815/status/1129489680662237184" target="_blank">self-help group therapy session</a>. Another example of such a talk would be the <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-940095-elektrogruselkabinet_indien_edition" target="_blank">Elektrogruselkabinet Indien-Edition</a>. But here, it's all about networks, ISPs, fiber optics, datacenters, ...</p>
          <p>Ever had to remove a switch from a rack using an angle grinder? Found out that you're renting your own service from a reseller? Had a router that - literally - crashed? Had a discussion with TAC about whether the misbehaving line-card can actually mechanically fit in the chassis where it's running?</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="title is-2">But the talk will be public?!</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We try to be your proxy server, so nobody will ever know it was you! ;-)</p>
          <p>Only submit material that can be published (redact sensitive information) and that you allow us to share in a conference talk! Please also tell us if you want to be named.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="title is-2">Submit</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We will collect your stories and compile a presentation. Best case: a picture and 3-4 sentences of what happened before, so the picture can be the punch line. We might also be able to use audio/video and can let you tell the story yourself. Please keep it short, so we can fit many stories into the talk.</p>
          <p>Here's an <a href="example/index.html" target="_blank">example of what we have in mind</a>.</p>
