          <p>We're collecting <strong>your</strong> horror stories and will share them as a conference talk, probably at the next <a href="https://www.denog.de/de/">DENOG</a> conference. This was inspired by the <a href="https://entropia.de/GPN18:Sysadmin_Nightmares_2018">Sysadmin Nightmares</a> talk at the Gulaschprogrammiernacht 2018. Unfortunatly, this talk was not streamed or recorded, so everyone could talk openly. Sysadmin Nightmares was accurately described<sup><a href="https://twitter.com/pennylane0815/status/1129489680662237184">1</a></sup> as <blockquote>self-help group therapy session</blockquote></p>
          <p>Ever had to remove a switch from a rack using an angle grinder? Found out that you're renting your own service from a reseller? Had a router that - literally - crashed? Had a discussion with TAC about whether the misbahaving line-card can actually mechanically fit in the chassis where it's running?</p>
          <p>We try to be your poxy server, so nobody will ever know it was you! ;-)</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>We will collect your stories and compile a presenatation. You can submit
            <ul>
              <li>pictures</li>
              <li>text (english/german - we might translate/summarize if needbe)</li>
              <li>audio (if you want to the story yourself)</li>
              <li>videos</li>
            </ul>
            or any combination of that. In most cases, pictures and a few sentences that explain what happened would be best. If you want to submit text/audio/video, please keep it short and don't turn it into a novel.<p>
          <p>Only submit material that you allow us to publish in a conference talk! Please also tell us if you want to be named.</p>
